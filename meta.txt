This is a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) application by Evan Ram.
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) may be used.
This application features a peer to peer (p2p) network.

TODO:
	Auto updating
		- Press a button in below proposed info menu item
		- Replace jar in background or replace certain classes in current jar (similar to `jar uf` command?)

	'Info' or 'About' menu item
		- Under 'App' menu
		- Display information such as application version
		- Possibly render an HTML page; certain elements of it can be replaced with online info (such as latest update info)

	Transparent GUI
		- This was previously mostly working (and it looked decent)
		- Not implemented due to rendering issues with the JMenus and JMenuItems while JFrame is transparent
	
	Option for UDP, TCP hole punching
		- Users should not have to port forward just to call others
		- Server software for others to run their own NAT
	
	SRTP or SRTCP
		- Encryption by default, Organized packet system
